Arthur set out before dawn, the pickup rattling gently as it rolled down the misty country road. In the passenger seat beside him was an empty rope and a folded tarp, both ready for the cow he planned to buy at the market in Millbrook. He had rehearsed the purchase in his head all morning — how much he would offer, what he would say, and how proud he would feel driving home with his new animal.

About halfway there, however, he felt a sudden lurch. The steering wheel tugged sharply to the right, and the familiar thump-thump of a flat tire filled the cab. Arthur groaned, easing the truck onto the shoulder. He stepped out into the cool air, staring at the deflated rear tire with a sinking feeling.

As he fumbled through his toolbox, a police cruiser pulled up behind him. Officer Robert stepped out, tipping his hat politely.

“Morning,” Robert said. “Looks like you’ve had some bad luck.”

Arthur explained about the market and the cow, embarrassed by his obvious frustration. Instead of simply offering a ticket or a warning, Robert rolled up his sleeves. Together, they loosened the lug nuts, jacked up the truck, and swapped the flat for the spare. They worked quietly but efficiently, the only sounds being metal against metal and the chirping of distant birds.

When the job was done, Arthur wiped his hands on a rag and smiled with relief.

“I don’t know what I would’ve done without you,” he said.

Robert simply nodded. “Just doing my job — and helping a neighbor.”

As the cruiser drove off, Arthur climbed back into his truck, feeling lighter than before. The tire trouble had delayed him, but it had also given him a small reminder: even on a rough road, kindness could make the journey a little smoother. And with that, he started the engine and continued toward the market, ready to bring home his cow.
